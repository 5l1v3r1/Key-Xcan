Key-Xcan
========
Key-Xcan is a free and open source Keylogger for windows. It is _mostly_ experimental software. <br />

I wrote this simple yet effective keylogger for education purposes! Most AV Should catch this with ease! <br />

--**** Use at your own risk. ****-- <br />

+ Tested on: Windows Multiple Variants. Last updated ~ 2008... No longer supported or even give a shit! <br />

Either replace the 00000s with actual data or write another program to inject it into the Binary code!
		
        Enjoy. :]
